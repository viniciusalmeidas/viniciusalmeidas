<h3><b>Talk is cheap. Show me the code.</b></h3>


I create ideas in Python, building apps that are enjoyable to use and really problem-solvers using a clean and understandable code.
Give me challenges. 


# Buy Me A Coffee! :coffee:

As some of you may already know, any of you can contribute buying the developer a coffee.

Buymeacoffee is a website that contacts developers, designers, artists, etc. with their communities so that people can contribute and help them out so that the content they offer is better since the rewarding system encourages creators to continue doing what they like and helping others.

If you can contribute or you want to, feel free to do it at [__Buy me a coffee! :coffee:__](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/vinialmeida), I will be really thankfull for anything even if it is a coffee or just a kind comment towards my work, because that helps me a lot. Whenever you contribute with a donation, I will read your message and it will be shown in my main site.

### Be careful and donate just if it is within your possibilities, because there is no refund system. And remember that you don't need to donate, it is just a free choice for you. Thank you!
